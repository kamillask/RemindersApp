## Team Design

We decided to remove the DB, User, and App classes from our individual designs because it was not mentioned in the requirements to actually implement them. We ended up adding our pros to the design. From design 1 we added multiplicities. This gives a better understanding of what is possible. From design 2 we added the simplicity to not make the design overcomplicated. From design 3, we added the multiple methods that were used to complete the requirements. From design 4, we used the idea of having fewer classes. From design 5, we also named all of our relationships so that it is easier to see how each class interacts with each other.

## Summary

As we progressed in our discussion regarding creating a UML diagram, we discussed different attributes and methods. We regularly communicated and shared resources to strengthen our understanding about UML diagrams. We outlined the pros and cons of each UML diagram and discussed in depth regarding its functionalities, multiplicities, and dependencies between classes. In the early stage of creating the UML design, we had to learn more about how to properly use UML arrows and we learned more about it by reading and watching videos about different types of uml realizations. By combining ideas from our individual designs, we created a new design that covered the requirements of the assignment. During our meetings, we openly shared our ideas and evaluated them to create our final product. A lesson learned is that even though we had the same requirements for the assignment our designs were not the same.
